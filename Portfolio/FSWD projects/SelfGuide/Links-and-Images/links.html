  <h1>Links</h1>
  <p>Using the a tag, here is an example of links and <a>images</a>. Which of course
  you will see nothing since a by itself does not produce anything.</p>
  <p>Trying again, with the attribute href, the <a href = 'images.html'>link</a>
     should now be accessible.</p>
  <p>Now to make a list of links! Three types to be exact.</p>
   <ul>
     <!--li items here-->
     <li><p>Absolute links are the most detailed. They come in three parts.
       Scheme which starts with http:// or https://, then domain name, and last
       the path to target web page. <a href = 'https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'>
       Mozilla Developer Network</a>. Absolute links are great for directing users
       to an offsite webpage.</p></li>
     <li><p>Relative links are from  the same scheme and domain. Example would be
       files from the same folder. You navigate from a file to another file in
       the same directory basically or deeper(folder inside folder)into the directory.
       <a href='misc/extras.html'>Hi neighbor!</a>. To go up a folder you would
       use syntax double dot .. before the initial folder location of current page.
       So if you were on extras.html the directories would look like "a href='../links.html".
       To go up multiple just keep adding more double dots with foward
       slashes like '../../../whatever.html'.</p></li>
      <li><p>Root-relative links are webpages that come directly from the "root" of the entire
       web page itself. This only works if the webpage was the host server, and an exampoe will be,
       <a href='/'>Home Page</a>. This link will not until a host server is created for the root directory.
       Root relative will start it's directorty with a foward slash.</p></li>
      <li><p>Link targets are a modification of "a" links. They are attributes to be added to the link target
       itself.<a href ='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'target='_blank'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>
       , this link will now open in a new tab or window.</p></li>
      <li><p>Images are brought in externally through files with an img tag and src attribute.The "img/" tag is an empty
        element, like breakline "br/". Here is a img link example, but will not load since I do not have the file
        </fieldset> <img src='some-photo.jpg'/>.</p></li>

      </ul>
