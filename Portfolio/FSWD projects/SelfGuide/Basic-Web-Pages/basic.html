 <h1>The Beginning</h1>
   <p>My first paragraph, this is really awesome.</p>
  <h2>Different Sized titles</h2>
   <p>Testing out different heading sizes that are labeled h1 (biggest)
     to h6 (smallest).</p>
  <h2>Epic Lists</h2>
   <h4>ul</h4>
    <p>Now to create an unordered list.</p>
     <ul>
      <li>First, must start with tags ul.</li>
      <li>Second, create tags li within ul.</li>
      <li>Create as many as you want.</li>
      <li><p>You must wrap p with li in the lists.</p></li>
     </ul>
    <p>Another type of list is ordered.</p>
   <h4>ol</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>This list is numbered for putting items in direct order.</li>
      <li>All you need is the ol tags.</li>
      <li>The interior li tags are used</li>
    </ol>
  <h2>Inlineception</h2>
   <h4>em</h4>
    <p>Inline elements go inside block code. We are going to start with
     <em>emphasis</em>, which letters are wrapped with the tag em. Em wrapped
      content are styled with italics</p>
   <h4>strong</h4>
    <p>Let's be <strong>strong</strong> with this sentence. The strong tag shows
     how <strong>important</strong> a phrase can be.</p>
   <h4>Combining Inline Elements</h4>
    <p><em><strong>This sentence is emphasized wrapped around strong within
      a paragraph!</strong></em></p>
  <h2>Empty Elements Conducting White Space</h2>
    <p>This sentence contains no empty elements even though
      I will try to put        alot of spaces      which should not work.</p>
    <p>This is my name that should be below this setence which will not work without
      empty elements.
      Insert name here.</p>
   <h4>br The breakline, hr The Horizontal line</h4>
    <p>The break line is not a wrap but just a no tail tag br/.<br/>This sentence
      has just been break lined.<br/>Now there is hr/, which is a horizontal rule
      and a lone tag, meaning it is thematic in it's purpose of structuring
      documents formally like,<hr/>putting a line, to put my name.<br/>
    <strong>insert name here</strong></p>
   <h4>The foward slash</h4>
    <p>The purpose of foward slash in tags like br/ and hr/ just means it is
    to denote that the tag is an closing statement</p>
   <h4>The Anchor</h4>
  <p>With the tag wrap a, links are created.<p>
